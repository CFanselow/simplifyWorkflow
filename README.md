About
-----
This plugin implements a number of smaller changes to adapt OMP's workflow to the workflow of Language Science Press. The adaptions are highly specific to Language Science Press and can thus not be used by other installations without major adaptations. For a detailed documenation of the changes made to OMP see the Langsci wiki page.
